# Doorlocksystemusing8051
The purpose of our project is to build a password based door lock system using 8051 microcontroller. Password base lock systems are very popular now-a-days because of their simple yet very effective applications. Password based systems are replacing traditional key and lock based system and password based lock systems are also more secure and user friendly than the traditional Key based systems.
